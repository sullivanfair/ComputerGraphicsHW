<!--  Demo of lighting using more detailed material and light
properties.  Same as Lighting2c otherwise.  Only changes are in
the fragment shader, which now gets material and light properties
as 3x3 matrices.  See Lighting3.js.

Keyboard controls for light position and direction.  Initially, the
light object is at 0, 4, 0 and is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about its x-axis so
negative z-axis is pointing at origin.  The yellow line is aligned with
the object's negative z-azis.
(I.e. it is "looking" down at the origin):
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>a, d - move light left, right (along its x axis)
<li>w, s - move light down, up (this is "forward" and "back" where light actually moves up/down along its z axis; notice
	that as you press the w key, the shadow gets larger)
<li>r, f - move light farther, closer (this is "up" and "down" where light will move along its y axis)
<li>i, k - look up, look down (light will initially turn away/towards you)
<li>j, l - turn left, turn right (rotate about world y, so has no effect initially)
<li>O - face origin (must not be aligned with y axis!)
<li>I, J, K, L - orbit down, right, up, left about origin
<li>x, X, y, Y, z, Z - positive/negative rotations about light's own axis
<li>c, C - increase or decrease the focus of the light</li>
<li>SPACE - pause rotation of cube
